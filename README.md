Image Quilter

An implementation of the [Image Quilting](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting/quilting.pdf)
algorithm. I made this just for fun. If you're a CS student and implementing this paper is one of your assignments - I
would recommend not copying this project as I've been kind of sloppy and I've taken some liberties with the cutting
algorithm (I used Dijstra's Algorithm instead of the paper's formula). Your professor would probably be like "wtf is
this shit?". But if you're just looking for an implementation of the image quilting algorithm, feel free to mess around
with this project. I hope to clean it up more later and make it more modular.
